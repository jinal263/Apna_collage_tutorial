        <h2>Basic Selectors</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Universal Selector</h3>
                <p>Selects all elements. Optionally, it may be restricted to a specific namespace or to all namespaces.
                </p>
                <em>Example: * will match all the elements of the document. </em>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Type selector</h3>
                <p>Selects all elements that have the given node name.</p>
                <em>Syntax: elementname{}</em>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Class selector</h3>
                <p>Selects all elements that have the given class attribute.</p>
                <em>Syntax: .classname

                    Example: .index will match any element that has class="index".

                </em>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>ID selector</h3>
                <p>Selects an element based on the value of its id attribute. There should be only one element with a
                    given
                    ID in a document.</p>
                <em>Syntax: #idname

                    Example: #toc will match the element that has id="toc".</em>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Attribute Selector</h3>
                <p>Selects all elements that have the given attribute.</p>
                <em>Syntax: [attr] [attr=value] [attr~=value] [attr|=value] [attr^=value] [attr$=value] [attr*=value]

                    Example: [autoplay] will match all elements that have the autoplay attribute set (to any
                    value).</em>

        <h2>Grouping Selectors</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h2>Selector list</h2>
                <p>When multiple selectors share the same declarations, they can be grouped together into a
                    comma-separated list. Selector lists can also be passed as parameters to some functional CSS
                    pseudo-classes. White space may appear before and/or after the comma.</p>
                <em>
                    Example: div, span will match both <span> and <div> elements.
                            <br>
                            span {
                            border: red 2px solid;

                            <br>
                            span,
                            div {

        <ol>
            <li>
                <h2>Descendant Combinator</h2>
                <p>The " " (space) combinator selects nodes that are descendants of the first element.</p>
                <em>Syntax: A B
                    Example: div span will match all <span> elements that are inside a <div> element
                </em>

            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Child Combinator </h2>
                <p>The > combinator selects nodes that are direct children of the first element.</p>
                <em>Syntax: A > B
                    <br>
                    Example: ul > li will match all
                    li elements that are nested directly inside a ul element.
                </em>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>General sibling combinator</h2>
                <p>The ~ combinator selects siblings. This means that the second element follows the first (though not
                    necessarily immediately), and both share the same parent.
                </p>
                <p>Syntax: A ~ B </p>
                <em>Example: p ~ span will match all span elements that follow a p element , immediately or not.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Adjacent sibling combinator</h2>
                <p>The + combinator matches the second element only if it immediately follows the first element.</p>
                <em>Syntax: A + B
                    <br>
                    Example: h2 + p will match the first p element that immediately follows an h2 element.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Column combinator</h2>
                <p>The || combinator selects nodes which belong to a column.</p>
                <em>Syntax: A || B
                    <br>
                    Example: col || td will match all td elements that belong to the scope of the
                    col.

        <h2>Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2>Pseudo classes</h2>
                <p>A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected
                    element(s). For example, the pseudo-class :hover can be used to select a button when a user's
                    pointer hovers over the button and this selected button can then be styled.

                <em>Example: a:visited will match all <a> elements that have been visited by the user.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>pseudo elements</h2>
                <p>A CSS pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the
                    selected element(s). For example, ::first-line can be used to change the font of the first line of a
                    paragraph.</p>

        <h2>Structure of a selector</h2>
        <p>the term 'selector' can refer to one of the following :</p>
        <ul type="square">
            <li>
                <h3>Simple selector</h3>
                <p>A selector with a single component, such as a single id selector or type selector, that's not used in
                    combination with or contains any other selector component or combinator. A given element is said to
                    match a simple selector when that simple selector accurately describes the element. All basic
                    selectors, attributes, and single pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements are simple selectors.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Compound selector</h3>
                <p>A sequence of simple selectors that are not separated by a combinator. A compound selector represents
                    a set of simultaneous conditions on a single element. A given element is said to match a compound
                    selector when the element matches all the simple selectors in the compound selector.

                    In a compound selector, the type selector or a universal selector in a compound selector must come
                    first in the sequence of selectors. Only one type selector or universal selector is allowed in the
                    sequence. Since whitespace represents the descendant combinator, no whitespace is allowed between
                    the simple selectors in a compound selector.</p>
                <em>Example: a#selected {...} </em>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Complex selector</h3>
                <p>A sequence of one or more simple and/or compound selectors that are separated by combinators. A
                    complex selector represents a set of simultaneous conditions on a set of elements. These conditions
                    apply in the context of relationships described by the combinators. A given element is said to match
                    a complex selector when the element matches compound selectors and the combinators between the
                    compound selectors.
                </p>
                <em>Examples: a#selected > .icon {...}, .box h2 + p {...}, a .icon {...}</em>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Relative selector</h3>
                <p>A selector that represents an element relative to one or more anchor elements preceded by a
                    combinator. Relative selectors that don't begin with an explicit combinator have an implied
                    descendant combinator.</p>
                <em>Examples: + div#topic > #reference {...}, > .icon {...}

                </em>
            </li>
        </ul>
