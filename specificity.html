    <h1>Specifics on CSS Specificity</h1>
    <h2>Calculating CSS Specificity Value</h2>
    <p>Why is that our first attempt at changing the color and font-weight failed? As we learned, it was because simply
        using the class name by itself had a lower specificity value and was trumped by the other selector which
        targeted the unordered list with the ID value. The important words in that sentence were class and ID. CSS
        applies vastly different specificity weights to classes and IDs. In fact, an ID has infinitely more specificity
        value! That is, no amount of classes alone can outweigh an ID.</p>
    \<h3>In otherwords:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If the element has inline styling, that automatically1 wins (1,0,0,0 points)</li>
        <li>For each ID value, apply 0,1,0,0 points</li>
        <li>For each class value (or pseudo-class or attribute selector), apply 0,0,1,0 points</li>
        <li>For each element reference, apply 0,0,0,1 point</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can generally read the values as if they were just a number, like 1,0,0,0 is “1000”, and so clearly wins over
        a specificity of 0,1,0,0 or “100”. The commas are there to remind us that this isn’t really a “base 10” system,
        in that you could technically have a specificity value of like 0,1,13,4 – and that “13” doesn’t spill over like
        a base 10 system would.</p>
