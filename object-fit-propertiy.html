    <h1>object-fit property</h1>
    <p>Here is where the object-fit property comes in. The object-fit property can take one of the following values:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>fill - This is default. The image is resized to fill the given dimension. If necessary, the image will be
            stretched or squished to fit</li>
        <li>contain - The image keeps its aspect ratio, but is resized to fit within the given dimension</li>
        <li> cover - The image keeps its aspect ratio and fills the given dimension. The image will be clipped to fit
            none - The image is not resized</li>
        <li> scale-down - the image is scaled down to the smallest version of none or contain</li>
    </ul>
