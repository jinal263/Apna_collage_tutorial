    <h1>Styling list</h1>
    <h2>List-specific styles</h2>
    <p>let's explore some list-specific properties. There are three properties you should know about to start with,
        which can be set on
        ul or ol elements:
    <ul style="list-style-type:space-counter;">
        <li>
            <h3>list-style-type</h3>
            <p> Sets the type of bullets to use for the list, for example, square or circle bullets for an unordered
                list, or numbers, letters, or roman numerals for an ordered list.</p>
            <h4><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style-type">for more info</a></h4>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>list-style-position</h3>
            <p>Sets whether the bullets, at the start of each item, appear inside or outside the lists.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>list-style-image</h3>
            <p> Allows you to use a custom image for the bullet, rather than a simple square or circle.

    <table>
        <caption>Styling table</caption>
        <thead>
            <th>table-layout</th>
            <th> border-collapse </th>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>table-layout: auto</td>
                <td>table-layout: fixed</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>border-collapse: collapse;</td>
                <td>border-collapse: separate;</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <h4>The most important parts to note are as follows:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>A table-layout value of fixed is generally a good idea to set on your table, as it makes the table behave
                a bit
                more predictably by default. Normally, table columns tend to be sized according to how much content they
                contain, which produces some strange results. With table-layout: fixed, you can size your columns
                according to
                the width of their headings, and then deal with their content as appropriate. This is why we've selected
                the
                four different headings with the thead th:nth-child(n) (:nth-child) selector ("Select the n-th child
                that is a
                th element in a sequence, inside a thead element") and given them set percentage widths. The entire
                column
                width follows the width of its heading, making for a nice way to size your table columns. Chris
                Coyier
                discusses this technique in more detail in Fixed Table Layouts. We've coupled this with a width
                of 100%,
                meaning that the table will fill any container it is put in, and be nicely responsive (although
                it would
                still need some more work to get it looking good on narrow screen widths).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>A border-collapse value of collapse is standard best practice for any table styling effort. By default,
                when you set borders on table elements, they will all have spacing between them, as the below image
                illustrates:</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
